# programming-challenges

**[WIP]**
My collection of programming challenges, covering many CS topics - made and curated by me.

## What's this?
This is meant to be a list of coding challenges for those who want to improve their skills. I have separated the problems by topic and put them in a increasing level of difficulty. Most of those were university assignments for me, but some of them I haven't solved yet.

If you want to improve your at coding, I suggest you try one of these, and if you have any suggestions on changes or things that can be added to this list, please open an issue. You're welcome to collaborate.

## How do I do this?

- search about the problem as much as you can. This is the part where you actually learn. Use Google, Wikipedia, Stack Overflow. Sometimes you're better off resorting to theoretical books, but there's plenty of free material online you can use;

- pick a language;

- implement it;

- be proud of it! yay

# Topics

## The essential

These are typically topics you'd be introduced to in the first or second year of a university computer science degree. That doesn't mean they're easier, it just means that they're foundational and have little to no prerequisites aside from elementary to high school math. If you're just starting, I recommend you pick these up first.

### Algorithms

### Computer Architecture

### Data Structures

### Discrete Mathematics and Algebra

### Linear Algebra

### Numerical Analysis

### Probability and Statistics

### Theory of Computation and Formal Languages

## Advanced topics

Those are usually what you'd get in the mid-to-final years of the undergraduate studies. Those topics assume you have knowledge of the previous ones, and might be more convoluted than the foundations, as in, they require some more previous knowledge.

### Artificial Intelligence

Rec: Algorithms, Data Structures, Probability and Statistics

### Compilers and Programming Languages

Rec: Theory of Computation and Formal Languages

### Databases

Rec: Data Structures

### Graph Theory

Rec: Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics and Algebra

### Machine Learning

Rec: Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Probability and Statistics

### Networking

Rec: Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer Architecture

### Operating Systems

Rec: Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer Architecture

### Optimization and Operations Research

Rec: Discrete Mathematics and Algebra, Linear Albegra

## Specializations

Those topics are usually opt-in. That means they're not for everyone and some of them may be interdisciplinary subjects or use very specific techniques. The pre-requisites for each one may vary drastically. I assume that if you're getting into one of these branches, you should know exactly what you need.

### Computer Geometry

### Computer Vision and Image Processing

### Emulation

### Games

### Graphics

### Heuristic Optimization and Meta-heuristics

### Information Theory

### Simulations

# Observations

I might have overlooked some topics that I'm not familiar with, but I'm open to suggestions. If you have any, just open an issue.
